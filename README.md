## 📌 Problem Statement

> *"Design and develop a tool that allows DevOps teams to monitor, analyze, and reduce the energy usage and associated emissions of their CI/CD pipelines."*

Every time a developer pushes code and a CI/CD build runs automatically — that single build consumes real electricity, produces real heat, and emits real CO₂. Multiply that by hundreds of builds per day across an organization, and the environmental and financial cost becomes enormous.

**The problem:** Not a single mainstream DevOps tool measures or manages this. Teams are completely blind to their pipeline's energy footprint.

**Our solution:** Green Cloud Optimization — a real-time dashboard that makes energy waste visible, calculates carbon emissions per build, detects idle resources, and suggests specific optimizations.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 Dashboard
- Live CPU and memory usage chart (updates every 5 seconds)
- Real-time energy consumption in Watts and kWh
- Carbon emission tracking in gCO₂eq per build
- Green Score indicator (0–100) per pipeline run
- Build duration history chart
- CI/CD pipeline list with per-build green badges

### ⚡ Pipeline Energy Calculator
- Interactive tool to model electrical and carbon impact of any CI/CD job
- **Inputs:** CPU TDP, Data Center Region, CPU Utilization %, Build Duration, Memory (GB), Facility PUE, Monthly Build Frequency
- **Outputs:** Energy Per Build (Wh), Carbon Impact (gCO₂eq), Monthly Fleet Projection (kWh, kg CO₂, USD cost)
- Supports multiple regions with real carbon intensity values (US-East 374 gCO₂/kWh, EU-West, US-West, IN-South, and more)

### 🔴 Idle Resource Alerts
- Detects when CPU falls below 10% threshold for sustained duration

## 🔬 Energy Formulas Used

All calculations are based on the **SPECpower industry model** and **Green Software Foundation SCI specification**.

### CPU Power
```
CPU_Power (W) = Idle_Power + (CPU_Utilization / 100) × (TDP − Idle_Power)

Where:
  Idle_Power = 10W  (minimum draw at 0% load)
  TDP        = selected processor thermal design power
```

### Memory Power
```
Memory_Power (W) = Memory_GB × 0.3725
```

### Total Server Power with PUE
```
Actual_Power (W) = (CPU_Power + Memory_Power) × PUE

Where:
  PUE = Power Usage Effectiveness (data center overhead multiplier)
```

### Energy Per Build
```
Energy_Wh  = Actual_Power × (Duration_Minutes / 60)
Energy_kWh = Energy_Wh / 1000
```

### Carbon Emission
```
CO₂ (grams) = Energy_kWh × Carbon_Intensity_Region (gCO₂/kWh)
```

### Monthly Fleet Projection
```
Monthly_Energy_kWh = Energy_kWh × Monthly_Builds
Monthly_Carbon_kg  = (Monthly_Energy_kWh × Carbon_Intensity) / 1000
Monthly_Cost_USD   = Monthly_Energy_kWh × Electricity_Rate ($0.12/kWh)
```

### Complete Single Formula
```
CO₂ (g) = [Idle_Power + (CPU%/100) × (TDP − Idle_Power) + (RAM_GB × 0.3725)]
           × PUE
           × (Duration_min / 60)
           × (1 / 1000)
           × Carbon_Intensity_Region
```

## 🌍 Supported Data Center Regions

| Region | Carbon Intensity | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| US-West | 110 gCO₂/kWh | Heavy hydro — cleanest US region |
| EU-West | 180 gCO₂/kWh | High renewable mix |
| US-East | 374 gCO₂/kWh | Mixed grid — default |
| AP-Southeast | 450 gCO₂/kWh | Asia Pacific |
| IN-South | 580 gCO₂/kWh | India South grid |
| CN-East | 760 gCO₂/kWh | China East — coal heavy |

> **Key insight:** The same build in US-West produces 8× less carbon than in a coal-heavy region — with zero code changes.

## 💡 How the Idle Alert Works

```
Every 5 seconds:
  Agent collects CPU % → writes to Firestore

useMetrics hook:
  Reads last 60 samples → calculates rolling average CPU

If avgCPU < 10% for sustained window:
  optimizationEngine.js → writes IDLE_SHUTDOWN recommendation
  createAlert() → writes alert to Firestore 'alerts' collection

useAlerts hook detects new alert:
  Fires custom DOM event → AlertBanner appears (red, top of page)
                        → ToastNotification fires (bottom right)
                        → OptimizationPanel shows recommendation card
```

## 🏆 Built At

This project was built during a **Hackathon** with the problem statement:

> *"Design and develop a tool that allows DevOps teams to monitor, analyze, and reduce the energy usage and associated emissions of their CI/CD pipelines."*

We developed this project to the best of our capacity within the hackathon timeframe, implementing real physics-based energy formulas, Firebase real-time monitoring, an optimization rule engine, idle detection alerts, ML predictions, and an interactive pipeline energy calculator.

---

## 🌱 Why This Matters

| Scale | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| 1 build | 2–5 gCO₂ |
| 100 builds/month | 0.2–0.5 kg CO₂ |
| 10,000 builds/month | 20–50 kg CO₂ |
| Large enterprise (100K builds) | 200–500 kg CO₂/month |

500 kg CO₂/month = equivalent to driving a car for 3,000 kilometers — just from automated code pipelines.

**Green Cloud Optimization makes this waste visible for the first time.**
